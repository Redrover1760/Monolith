  A Protogen is a technologically enhanced being made of both technological and biological parts. Though they have a mix of artificial and non-artificial organs, they still operate with a soul and mind, yet there are also program files that operate them, and overheating/overcooling can damage the circuits of the artificial organs. They still need to eat and be healed using normal medicines.

  They are capable of playing digital music innately and suffer less damage from lacking air.

  Their armored bodies makes them take 20% less Blunt damage, 10% less Piercing/Slash damage. Their electronic nature makes them take 1.3x heat, 1.3x cold, 1.5x shock and 1.5x radiation damage.
