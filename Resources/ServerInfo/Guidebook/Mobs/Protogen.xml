  A Protogen is a technologically enhanced being made of both technological and biological parts. Though they have a mix of artificial and non-artificial organs, they still operate with a soul and mind, yet there are also program files that operate them, and overheating/overcooling can damage the circuits of the artificial organs. They still need to eat and be healed using normal medicines.

  They are capable of playing music and take less damage from asphyixiation. They are also armored against brute damage but are more vulnerable to heat, radiation, and shock.
